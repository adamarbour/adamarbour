## Hi there 👋

My name is Adam Arbour[^1]. I grew up on a computer writing DOS commands and learning [Turbo C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C) as a child, sometime between the release of Windows 1.0 and Windows 3.1.

I am a person with many interests, ideas, and ambitions. My hero is "[me in 10 years](https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/your-hero-should-be-your-10-year-self-in-the-future-matthew-mcconaughey-oscar-speech-27d57b5e3589)". Today, I mostly consult and help companies with `data strategy` and `digital transformation`. In my own time, I like to tinker and pursue goals and projects that align with my [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai).

## Interfaces💻
Recently I've embarked on a journey of _technology minimalism_ and have been tearing myself away from the numerous devices _(read 2x iPads, 3x laptops, desktop, gaming devices, servers, phone, ereader ... gadgets galore)_ that I interface/tinker with on a daily basis. I've resolved to reduce my toys and will focus primarily on a small powerhorse

## Connect 👨‍💻

There are surprisingly many active Adam Arbours on the _#interwebs_, so I don't have a consistent handle across `Web2` and `Web3`. I also don't maintain the largest _social footprint_. You can find me at the links below:
